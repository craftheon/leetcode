    Given the `root` of a binary tree, return _the average value of the nodes on each level in the form of an array_. Answers within `10-5` of the actual answer will be accepted.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/03/09/avg1-tree.jpg)```javascript 
Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: [3.00000,14.50000,11.00000]
Explanation: The average value of nodes on level 0 is 3, on level 1 is 14.5, and on level 2 is 11.
Hence return [3, 14.5, 11].
```

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/03/09/avg2-tree.jpg)```javascript 
Input: root = [3,9,20,15,7]
Output: [3.00000,14.50000,11.00000]
```

**Constraints:**

*   The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 104]`.
*   `-231 <= Node.val <= 231 - 1`
