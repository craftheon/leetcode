<Problem slug="path-sum-iii" id="437" title="Path Sum III" difficulty="Medium" tags={[{"name":"Tree","slug":"tree"},{"name":"Depth-First Search","slug":"depth-first-search"},{"name":"Binary Tree","slug":"binary-tree"}]} >
    Given the `root` of a binary tree and an integer `targetSum`, return _the number of paths where the sum of the values along the path equals_ `targetSum`.

The path does not need to start or end at the root or a leaf, but it must go downwards (i.e., traveling only from parent nodes to child nodes).

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/04/09/pathsum3-1-tree.jpg)
```javascript 
Input: root = [10,5,-3,3,2,null,11,3,-2,null,1], targetSum = 8
Output: 3
Explanation: The paths that sum to 8 are shown.

```

**Example 2:**

```javascript 
Input: root = [5,4,8,11,null,13,4,7,2,null,null,5,1], targetSum = 22
Output: 3

```

**Constraints:**

*   The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 1000]`.
*   `-109 <= Node.val <= 109`
*   `-1000 <= targetSum <= 1000`
