    Given a string `s`, find the length of the **longest** **substring** without repeating characters.

**Example 1:**

```javascript 
Input: s = "abcabcbb"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.

```

**Example 2:**

```javascript 
Input: s = "bbbbb"
Output: 1
Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.

```

**Example 3:**

```javascript 
Input: s = "pwwkew"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.
Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.

```

**Constraints:**

*   `0 <= s.length <= 5 * 104`
*   `s` consists of English letters, digits, symbols and spaces.
