<Problem slug="best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock" id="121" title="Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock" difficulty="Easy" tags={[{"name":"Array","slug":"array"},{"name":"Dynamic Programming","slug":"dynamic-programming"}]} >
    You are given an array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `ith` day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a **single day** to buy one stock and choosing a **different day in the future** to sell that stock.

Return _the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction_. If you cannot achieve any profit, return `0`.

**Example 1:**

```javascript 
Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.

```

**Example 2:**

```javascript 
Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transactions are done and the max profit = 0.

```

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= prices.length <= 105`
*   `0 <= prices[i] <= 104`
</Problem >

<Code>
```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} prices
 * @return {number}
 */
var maxProfit = function (prices) {
  let min = prices[0], max = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i < prices.length; i++) {
    if (prices[i] < min) {
      min = prices[i];
    } else {
      max = Math.max(max, prices[i] - min)
    }
  }
  return max;
};
```
