    Given a `triangle` array, return _the minimum path sum from top to bottom_.

For each step, you may move to an adjacent number of the row below. More formally, if you are on index `i` on the current row, you may move to either index `i` or index `i + 1` on the next row.

**Example 1:**

```javascript 
Input: triangle = [[2],[3,4],[6,5,7],[4,1,8,3]]
Output: 11
Explanation: The triangle looks like:
   2
  3 4
 6 5 7
4 1 8 3
The minimum path sum from top to bottom is 2 + 3 + 5 + 1 = 11 (underlined above).
```

**Example 2:**

```javascript 
Input: triangle = [[-10]]
Output: -10
```

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= triangle.length <= 200`
*   `triangle[0].length == 1`
*   `triangle[i].length == triangle[i - 1].length + 1`
*   `-104 <= triangle[i][j] <= 104`

**Follow up:** Could youÂ do this using only `O(n)` extra space, where `n` is the total number of rows in the triangle?
