<Problem slug="max-number-of-k-sum-pairs" id="1798" title="Max Number of K-Sum Pairs" difficulty="Medium" tags={[{"name":"Array","slug":"array"},{"name":"Hash Table","slug":"hash-table"},{"name":"Two Pointers","slug":"two-pointers"},{"name":"Sorting","slug":"sorting"}]} >
    You are given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`.

In one operation, you can pick two numbers from the array whose sum equals `k` and remove them from the array.

Return _the maximum number of operations you can perform on the array_.

**Example 1:**

```javascript 
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4], k = 5
Output: 2
Explanation: Starting with nums = [1,2,3,4]:
- Remove numbers 1 and 4, then nums = [2,3]
- Remove numbers 2 and 3, then nums = []
There are no more pairs that sum up to 5, hence a total of 2 operations.```

**Example 2:**

```javascript 
Input: nums = [3,1,3,4,3], k = 6
Output: 1
Explanation: Starting with nums = [3,1,3,4,3]:
- Remove the first two 3's, then nums = [1,4,3]
There are no more pairs that sum up to 6, hence a total of 1 operation.```

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= nums.length <= 105`
*   `1 <= nums[i] <= 109`
*   `1 <= k <= 109`
