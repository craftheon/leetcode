<Problem slug="reverse-nodes-in-k-group" id="25" title="Reverse Nodes in k-Group" difficulty="Hard" tags={[{"name":"Linked List","slug":"linked-list"},{"name":"Recursion","slug":"recursion"}]} >
    Given the `head` of a linked list, reverse the nodes of the list `k` at a time, and return _the modified list_.

`k` is a positive integer and is less than or equal to the length of the linked list. If the number of nodes is not a multiple of `k` then left-out nodes, in the end, should remain as it is.

You may not alter the values in the list's nodes, only nodes themselves may be changed.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/03/reverse_ex1.jpg)
```javascript 
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 2
Output: [2,1,4,3,5]

```

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/03/reverse_ex2.jpg)
```javascript 
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 3
Output: [3,2,1,4,5]

```

**Constraints:**

*   The number of nodes in the list is `n`.
*   `1 <= k <= n <= 5000`
*   `0 <= Node.val <= 1000`

**Follow-up:** Can you solve the problem in `O(1)` extra memory space?
