<Problem slug="container-with-most-water" id="11" title="Container With Most Water" difficulty="Medium" tags={[{"name":"Array","slug":"array"},{"name":"Two Pointers","slug":"two-pointers"},{"name":"Greedy","slug":"greedy"}]} >
    You are given an integer array `height` of length `n`. There are `n` vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the `ith` line are `(i, 0)` and `(i, height[i])`.

Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Return _the maximum amount of water a container can store_.

**Notice** that you may not slant the container.

**Example 1:**

```javascript 
Input: height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
Output: 49
Explanation: The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.
```

**Example 2:**

```javascript 
Input: height = [1,1]
Output: 1
```

**Constraints:**

*   `n == height.length`
*   `2 <= n <= 105`
*   `0 <= height[i] <= 104`
