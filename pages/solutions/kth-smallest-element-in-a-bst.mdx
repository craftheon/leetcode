<Problem slug="kth-smallest-element-in-a-bst" id="230" title="Kth Smallest Element in a BST" difficulty="Medium" tags={[{"name":"Tree","slug":"tree"},{"name":"Depth-First Search","slug":"depth-first-search"},{"name":"Binary Search Tree","slug":"binary-search-tree"},{"name":"Binary Tree","slug":"binary-tree"}]} >
    Given the `root` of a binary search tree, and an integer `k`, return _the_ `kth` _smallest value (**1-indexed**) of all the values of the nodes in the tree_.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/01/28/kthtree1.jpg)
```javascript 
Input: root = [3,1,4,null,2], k = 1
Output: 1
```

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/01/28/kthtree2.jpg)
```javascript 
Input: root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,null,1], k = 3
Output: 3
```

**Constraints:**

*   The number of nodes in the tree is `n`.
*   `1 <= k <= n <= 104`
*   `0 <= Node.val <= 104`

**Follow up:** If the BST is modified often (i.e., we can do insert and delete operations) and you need to find the kth smallest frequently, how would you optimize?
