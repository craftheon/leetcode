    Given a binary search tree (BST), find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) node of two given nodes in the BST.

According to the [definition of LCA on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lowest_common_ancestor): “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes `p` and `q` as the lowest node in `T` that has both `p` and `q` as descendants (where we allow **a node to be a descendant of itself**).”

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/14/binarysearchtree_improved.png)
```javascript 
Input: root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5], p = 2, q = 8
Output: 6
Explanation: The LCA of nodes 2 and 8 is 6.

```

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/14/binarysearchtree_improved.png)
```javascript 
Input: root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5], p = 2, q = 4
Output: 2
Explanation: The LCA of nodes 2 and 4 is 2, since a node can be a descendant of itself according to the LCA definition.

```

**Example 3:**

```javascript 
Input: root = [2,1], p = 2, q = 1
Output: 2

```

**Constraints:**

*   The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[2, 105]`.
*   `-109 <= Node.val <= 109`
*   All `Node.val` are **unique**.
*   `p != q`
*   `p` and `q` will exist in the BST.

<Code>
```javascript
/**
 * @param {TreeNode} root
 * @param {TreeNode} p
 * @param {TreeNode} q
 * @return {TreeNode}
 */
var lowestCommonAncestor = function (root, p, q) {
  let max = Math.max(p.val, q.val),
    min = Math.min(p.val, q.val)
  if (root.val === min || root.val === max) return root
  if (root.val < max && root.val > min) return root
  return lowestCommonAncestor(min > root.val ? root.right : root.left, p, q)
};
```
