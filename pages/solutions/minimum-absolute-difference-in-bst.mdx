    Given the `root` of a Binary Search Tree (BST), return _the minimum absolute difference between the values of any two different nodes in the tree_.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/02/05/bst1.jpg)```javascript 
Input: root = [4,2,6,1,3]
Output: 1
```

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/02/05/bst2.jpg)```javascript 
Input: root = [1,0,48,null,null,12,49]
Output: 1
```

**Constraints:**

*   The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[2, 104]`.
*   `0 <= Node.val <= 105`

**Note:** This question is the same as 783: [https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-distance-between-bst-nodes/](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-distance-between-bst-nodes/)
