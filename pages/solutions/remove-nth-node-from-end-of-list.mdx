    Given the `head` of a linked list, remove the `nth` node from the end of the list and return its head.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/03/remove_ex1.jpg)
```javascript 
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], n = 2
Output: [1,2,3,5]

```

**Example 2:**

```javascript 
Input: head = [1], n = 1
Output: []

```

**Example 3:**

```javascript 
Input: head = [1,2], n = 1
Output: [1]

```

**Constraints:**

*   The number of nodes in the list is `sz`.
*   `1 <= sz <= 30`
*   `0 <= Node.val <= 100`
*   `1 <= n <= sz`

**Follow up:** Could you do this in one pass?
