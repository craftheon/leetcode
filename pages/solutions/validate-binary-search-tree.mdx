    Given the `root` of a binary tree, _determine if it is a valid binary search tree (BST)_.

A **valid BST** is defined as follows:

*   The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys **less than** the node's key.
*   The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys **greater than** the node's key.
*   Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.

**Example 1:**

```javascript 
Input: root = [2,1,3]
Output: true

```

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/12/01/tree2.jpg)
```javascript 
Input: root = [5,1,4,null,null,3,6]
Output: false
Explanation: The root node's value is 5 but its right child's value is 4.

```

**Constraints:**

*   The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 104]`.
*   `-231 <= Node.val <= 231 - 1`
