    Given the `root` of a binary search tree and an integer `k`, return `true` _if there exist two elements in the BST such that their sum is equal to_ `k`, _or_ `false` _otherwise_.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/09/21/sum_tree_1.jpg)```javascript 
Input: root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,7], k = 9
Output: true
```

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/09/21/sum_tree_2.jpg)```javascript 
Input: root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,7], k = 28
Output: false
```

**Constraints:**

*   The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 104]`.
*   `-104 <= Node.val <= 104`
*   `root` is guaranteed to be a **valid** binary search tree.
*   `-105 <= k <= 105`
