    Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return _indices of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`_.

You may assume that each input would have **_exactly_ one solution**, and you may not use the _same_ element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.

**Example 1:**

```javascript 
Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].

```

**Example 2:**

```javascript 
Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6
Output: [1,2]

```

**Example 3:**

```javascript 
Input: nums = [3,3], target = 6
Output: [0,1]

```

**Constraints:**

*   `2 <= nums.length <= 104`
*   `-109 <= nums[i] <= 109`
*   `-109 <= target <= 109`
*   **Only one valid answer exists.**

**Follow-up:** Can you come up with an algorithm that is less than `O(n2)` time complexity?
