    Given an integer array `nums`, rotate the array to the right by `k` steps, where `k` is non-negative.

**Example 1:**

```javascript 
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7], k = 3
Output: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]
Explanation:
rotate 1 steps to the right: [7,1,2,3,4,5,6]
rotate 2 steps to the right: [6,7,1,2,3,4,5]
rotate 3 steps to the right: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]

```

**Example 2:**

```javascript 
Input: nums = [-1,-100,3,99], k = 2
Output: [3,99,-1,-100]
Explanation: 
rotate 1 steps to the right: [99,-1,-100,3]
rotate 2 steps to the right: [3,99,-1,-100]

```

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= nums.length <= 105`
*   `-231 <= nums[i] <= 231 - 1`
*   `0 <= k <= 105`

**Follow up:**

*   Try to come up with as many solutions as you can. There are at least **three** different ways to solve this problem.
*   Could you do it in-place with `O(1)` extra space?
