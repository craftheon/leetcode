<Problem slug="string-compression" id="443" title="String Compression" difficulty="Medium" tags={[{"name":"Two Pointers","slug":"two-pointers"},{"name":"String","slug":"string"}]} >
    Given an array of characters `chars`, compress it using the following algorithm:

Begin with an empty string `s`. For each group of **consecutive repeating characters** in `chars`:

*   If the group's length is `1`, append the character to `s`.
*   Otherwise, append the character followed by the group's length.

The compressed string `s` **should not be returned separately**, but instead, be stored **in the input character array `chars`**. Note that group lengths that are `10` or longer will be split into multiple characters in `chars`.

After you are done **modifying the input array,** return _the new length of the array_.

You must write an algorithm that uses only constant extra space.

**Example 1:**

```javascript 
Input: chars = ["a","a","b","b","c","c","c"]
Output: Return 6, and the first 6 characters of the input array should be: ["a","2","b","2","c","3"]
Explanation: The groups are "aa", "bb", and "ccc". This compresses to "a2b2c3".
```

**Example 2:**

```javascript 
Input: chars = ["a"]
Output: Return 1, and the first character of the input array should be: ["a"]
Explanation: The only group is "a", which remains uncompressed since it's a single character.
```

**Example 3:**

```javascript 
Input: chars = ["a","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b"]
Output: Return 4, and the first 4 characters of the input array should be: ["a","b","1","2"].
Explanation: The groups are "a" and "bbbbbbbbbbbb". This compresses to "ab12".```

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= chars.length <= 2000`
*   `chars[i]` is a lowercase English letter, uppercase English letter, digit, or symbol.
