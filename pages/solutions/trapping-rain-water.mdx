    Given `n` non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is `1`, compute how much water it can trap after raining.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/10/22/rainwatertrap.png)```javascript 
Input: height = [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]
Output: 6
Explanation: The above elevation map (black section) is represented by array [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]. In this case, 6 units of rain water (blue section) are being trapped.
```

**Example 2:**

```javascript 
Input: height = [4,2,0,3,2,5]
Output: 9
```

**Constraints:**

*   `n == height.length`
*   `1 <= n <= 2 * 104`
*   `0 <= height[i] <= 105`
