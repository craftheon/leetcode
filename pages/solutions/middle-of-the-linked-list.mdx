    Given the `head` of a singly linked list, return _the middle node of the linked list_.

If there are two middle nodes, return **the second middle** node.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/07/23/lc-midlist1.jpg)
```javascript 
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: [3,4,5]
Explanation: The middle node of the list is node 3.

```

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/07/23/lc-midlist2.jpg)
```javascript 
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
Output: [4,5,6]
Explanation: Since the list has two middle nodes with values 3 and 4, we return the second one.

```

**Constraints:**

*   The number of nodes in the list is in the range `[1, 100]`.
*   `1 <= Node.val <= 100`

<Code>
```javascript
/**
 * @param {ListNode} head
 * @return {ListNode}
 */
var middleNode = function (head) {
  if (!head || !head.next) return head;
  let slow = head,
    fast = head;
  while (fast && fast.next) {
    slow = slow.next;
    fast = fast.next.next;
  }
  return slow;
};
```
