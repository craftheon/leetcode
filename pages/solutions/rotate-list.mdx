    Given the `head` of a linkedÂ list, rotate the list to the right by `k` places.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/11/13/rotate1.jpg)```javascript 
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 2
Output: [4,5,1,2,3]
```

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/11/13/roate2.jpg)```javascript 
Input: head = [0,1,2], k = 4
Output: [2,0,1]
```

**Constraints:**

*   The number of nodes in the list is in the range `[0, 500]`.
*   `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`
*   `0 <= k <= 2 * 109`
