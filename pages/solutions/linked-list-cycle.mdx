<Problem slug="linked-list-cycle" id="141" title="Linked List Cycle" difficulty="Easy" tags={[{"name":"Hash Table","slug":"hash-table"},{"name":"Linked List","slug":"linked-list"},{"name":"Two Pointers","slug":"two-pointers"}]} >
    Given `head`, the head of a linked list, determine if the linked list has a cycle in it.

There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by continuously following the `next` pointer. Internally, `pos` is used to denote the index of the node that tail's `next` pointer is connected to. **Note that `pos` is not passed as a parameter**.

Return `true` _if there is a cycle in the linked list_. Otherwise, return `false`.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/07/circularlinkedlist.png)
```javascript 
Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
Output: true
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to the 1st node (0-indexed).

```

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/07/circularlinkedlist_test2.png)
```javascript 
Input: head = [1,2], pos = 0
Output: true
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to the 0th node.

```

**Example 3:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/07/circularlinkedlist_test3.png)
```javascript 
Input: head = [1], pos = -1
Output: false
Explanation: There is no cycle in the linked list.

```

**Constraints:**

*   The number of the nodes in the list is in the range `[0, 104]`.
*   `-105 <= Node.val <= 105`
*   `pos` is `-1` or a **valid index** in the linked-list.

**Follow up:** Can you solve it using `O(1)` (i.e. constant) memory?

<Code>
```javascript
/**
 * @param {ListNode} head
 * @return {boolean}
 */
var hasCycle = function (head) {
  if (!head || !head.next) return false;
  let slow = head,
    fast = head.next;
  while (slow !== fast) {
    if (!fast || !fast.next) return false;
    slow = slow.next;
    fast = fast.next.next;
  }
  return true;
};
```
