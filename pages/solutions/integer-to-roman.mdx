    Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: `I`, `V`, `X`, `L`, `C`, `D` and `M`.

```javascript 
Symbol       Value
I             1
V             5
X             10
L             50
C             100
D             500
M             1000
```

For example, `2` is written as `II` in Roman numeral, just two one's added together. `12` is written as `XII`, which is simply `X + II`. The number `27` is written as `XXVII`, which is `XX + V + II`.

Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. However, the numeral for four is not `IIII`. Instead, the number four is written as `IV`. Because the one is before the five we subtract it making four. The same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as `IX`. There are six instances where subtraction is used:

*   `I` can be placed before `V` (5) and `X` (10) to make 4 and 9. 
*   `X` can be placed before `L` (50) and `C` (100) to make 40 and 90. 
*   `C` can be placed before `D` (500) and `M` (1000) to make 400 and 900.

Given an integer, convert it to a roman numeral.

**Example 1:**

```javascript 
Input: num = 3
Output: "III"
Explanation: 3 is represented as 3 ones.

```

**Example 2:**

```javascript 
Input: num = 58
Output: "LVIII"
Explanation: L = 50, V = 5, III = 3.

```

**Example 3:**

```javascript 
Input: num = 1994
Output: "MCMXCIV"
Explanation: M = 1000, CM = 900, XC = 90 and IV = 4.

```

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= num <= 3999`
