<Problem slug="add-two-numbers" id="2" title="Add Two Numbers" difficulty="Medium" tags={[{"name":"Linked List","slug":"linked-list"},{"name":"Math","slug":"math"},{"name":"Recursion","slug":"recursion"}]} >
    You are given two **non-empty** linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in **reverse order**, and each of their nodes contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sumÂ as a linked list.

You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/02/addtwonumber1.jpg)```javascript 
Input: l1 = [2,4,3], l2 = [5,6,4]
Output: [7,0,8]
Explanation: 342 + 465 = 807.
```

**Example 2:**

```javascript 
Input: l1 = [0], l2 = [0]
Output: [0]
```

**Example 3:**

```javascript 
Input: l1 = [9,9,9,9,9,9,9], l2 = [9,9,9,9]
Output: [8,9,9,9,0,0,0,1]
```

**Constraints:**

*   The number of nodes in each linked list is in the range `[1, 100]`.
*   `0 <= Node.val <= 9`
*   It is guaranteed that the list represents a number that does not have leading zeros.
