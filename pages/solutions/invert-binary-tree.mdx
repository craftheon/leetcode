```javascript 
Input: root = [4,2,7,1,3,6,9]
Output: [4,7,2,9,6,3,1]

```

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/03/14/invert2-tree.jpg)
```javascript 
Input: root = [2,1,3]
Output: [2,3,1]

```

**Example 3:**

```javascript 
Input: root = []
Output: []

```

**Constraints:**

*   The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 100]`.
*   `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`
