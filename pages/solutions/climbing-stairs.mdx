    You are climbing a staircase. It takes `n` steps to reach the top.

Each time you can either climb `1` or `2` steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

**Example 1:**

```javascript 
Input: n = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: There are two ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step
2. 2 steps

```

**Example 2:**

```javascript 
Input: n = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: There are three ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step + 1 step
2. 1 step + 2 steps
3. 2 steps + 1 step

```

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= n <= 45`

<Code>
```javascript
/**
 * @param {number} n
 * @return {number}
 */
var climbStairs = function (n) {
  const dp = new Array(n).fill(0)
  dp[0] = 1
  dp[1] = 1
  for (let i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
    dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2]
  }
  return dp[n]
};
```
