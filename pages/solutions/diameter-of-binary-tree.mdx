<Problem slug="diameter-of-binary-tree" id="543" title="Diameter of Binary Tree" difficulty="Easy" tags={[{"name":"Tree","slug":"tree"},{"name":"Depth-First Search","slug":"depth-first-search"},{"name":"Binary Tree","slug":"binary-tree"}]} >
    Given the `root` of a binary tree, return _the length of the **diameter** of the tree_.

The **diameter** of a binary tree is the **length** of the longest path between any two nodes in a tree. This path may or may not pass through the `root`.

The **length** of a path between two nodes is represented by the number of edges between them.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/03/06/diamtree.jpg)
```javascript 
Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 3
Explanation: 3 is the length of the path [4,2,1,3] or [5,2,1,3].

```

**Example 2:**

```javascript 
Input: root = [1,2]
Output: 1

```

**Constraints:**

*   The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 104]`.
*   `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`

<Code>
```javascript
/**
 * @param {TreeNode} root
 * @return {number}
 */
var diameterOfBinaryTree = function(root) {
    let res = 0
    const reserve = function(root) {
      if (!root) return null
      let l = reserve(root.left),
        r = reserve(root.right)
      res = Math.max(res, l + r)
      return Math.max(l, r) + 1
    }
    reserve(root)
    return res
};
```
</Code>
