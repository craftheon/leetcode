    Given a string `s` and an integer `k`, return _the maximum number of vowel letters in any substring of_ `s` _with length_ `k`.

**Vowel letters** in English are `'a'`, `'e'`, `'i'`, `'o'`, and `'u'`.

**Example 1:**

```javascript

**Example 3:**

```javascript 
Input: s = "leetcode", k = 3
Output: 2
Explanation: "lee", "eet" and "ode" contain 2 vowels.
