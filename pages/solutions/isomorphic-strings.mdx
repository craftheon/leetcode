    Given two strings `s` and `t`, _determine if they are isomorphic_.

Two strings `s` and `t` are isomorphic if the characters in `s` can be replaced to get `t`.

All occurrences of a character must be replaced with another character while preserving the order of characters. No two characters may map to the same character, but a character may map to itself.

**Example 1:**

```javascript 
Input: s = "egg", t = "add"
Output: true

```

**Example 2:**

```javascript 
Input: s = "foo", t = "bar"
Output: false

```

**Example 3:**

```javascript 
Input: s = "paper", t = "title"
Output: true

```

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= s.length <= 5 * 104`
*   `t.length == s.length`
*   `s` and `t` consist of any valid ascii character.
