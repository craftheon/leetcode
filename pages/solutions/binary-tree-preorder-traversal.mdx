    Given the `root` of a binary tree, return _the preorder traversal of its nodes' values_.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/09/15/inorder_1.jpg)
```javascript 
Input: root = [1,null,2,3]
Output: [1,2,3]

```

**Example 2:**

```javascript 
Input: root = []
Output: []

```

**Example 3:**

```javascript 
Input: root = [1]
Output: [1]

```

**Constraints:**

*   The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 100]`.
*   `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`

**Follow up:** Recursive solution is trivial, could you do it iteratively?
