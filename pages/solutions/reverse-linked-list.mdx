<Problem slug="reverse-linked-list" id="206" title="Reverse Linked List" difficulty="Easy" tags={[{"name":"Linked List","slug":"linked-list"},{"name":"Recursion","slug":"recursion"}]} >
    Given the `head` of a singly linked list, reverse the list, and return _the reversed list_.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/02/19/rev1ex1.jpg)
```javascript 
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: [5,4,3,2,1]

```

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/02/19/rev1ex2.jpg)
```javascript 
Input: head = [1,2]
Output: [2,1]

```

**Example 3:**

```javascript 
Input: head = []
Output: []

```

**Constraints:**

*   The number of nodes in the list is the range `[0, 5000]`.
*   `-5000 <= Node.val <= 5000`

**Follow up:** A linked list can be reversed either iteratively or recursively. Could you implement both?
