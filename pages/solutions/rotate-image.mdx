<Problem slug="rotate-image" id="48" title="Rotate Image" difficulty="Medium" tags={[{"name":"Array","slug":"array"},{"name":"Math","slug":"math"},{"name":"Matrix","slug":"matrix"}]} >
    You are given an `n x n` 2D `matrix` representing an image, rotate the image by **90** degrees (clockwise).

You have to rotate the image [**in-place**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm), which means you have to modify the input 2D matrix directly. **DO NOT** allocate another 2D matrix and do the rotation.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/08/28/mat1.jpg)
```javascript 
Input: matrix = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]
Output: [[7,4,1],[8,5,2],[9,6,3]]
```

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/08/28/mat2.jpg)
```javascript 
Input: matrix = [[5,1,9,11],[2,4,8,10],[13,3,6,7],[15,14,12,16]]
Output: [[15,13,2,5],[14,3,4,1],[12,6,8,9],[16,7,10,11]]
```

**Constraints:**

*   `n == matrix.length == matrix[i].length`
*   `1 <= n <= 20`
*   `-1000 <= matrix[i][j] <= 1000`
