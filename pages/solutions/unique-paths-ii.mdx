    You are given an `m x n` integer array `grid`. There is a robot initially located at the **top-left corner** (i.e., `grid[0][0]`). The robot tries to move to the **bottom-right corner** (i.e., `grid[m - 1][n - 1]`). The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time.

An obstacle and space are marked as `1` or `0` respectively in `grid`. A path that the robot takes cannot include **any** square that is an obstacle.

Return _the number of possible unique paths that the robot can take to reach the bottom-right corner_.

The testcases are generated so that the answer will be less than or equal to `2 * 109`.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/11/04/robot1.jpg)```javascript 
Input: obstacleGrid = [[0,0,0],[0,1,0],[0,0,0]]
Output: 2
Explanation: There is one obstacle in the middle of the 3x3 grid above.
There are two ways to reach the bottom-right corner:
1. Right -> Right -> Down -> Down
2. Down -> Down -> Right -> Right
```

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/11/04/robot2.jpg)```javascript 
Input: obstacleGrid = [[0,1],[0,0]]
Output: 1
```

**Constraints:**

*   `m == obstacleGrid.length`
*   `n == obstacleGrid[i].length`
*   `1 <= m, n <= 100`
*   `obstacleGrid[i][j]` is `0` or `1`.
