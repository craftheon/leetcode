<Problem slug="partition-list" id="86" title="Partition List" difficulty="Medium" tags={[{"name":"Linked List","slug":"linked-list"},{"name":"Two Pointers","slug":"two-pointers"}]} >
    Given the `head` of a linked list and a value `x`, partition it such that all nodes **less than** `x` come before nodes **greater than or equal** to `x`.

You should **preserve** the original relative order of the nodes in each of the two partitions.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/01/04/partition.jpg)```javascript 
Input: head = [1,4,3,2,5,2], x = 3
Output: [1,2,2,4,3,5]
```

**Example 2:**

```javascript 
Input: head = [2,1], x = 2
Output: [1,2]
```

**Constraints:**

*   The number of nodes in the list is in the range `[0, 200]`.
*   `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`
*   `-200 <= x <= 200`
