    You are given a **0-indexed** array of integers `nums` of length `n`. You are initially positioned at `nums[0]`.

Each element `nums[i]` represents the maximum length of a forward jump from index `i`. In other words, if you are at `nums[i]`, you can jump to any `nums[i + j]` where:

*   `0 <= j <= nums[i]` and
*   `i + j < n`

Return _the minimum number of jumps to reach_ `nums[n - 1]`. The test cases are generated such that you can reach `nums[n - 1]`.

**Example 1:**

```javascript 
Input: nums = [2,3,1,1,4]
Output: 2
Explanation: The minimum number of jumps to reach the last index is 2. Jump 1 step from index 0 to 1, then 3 steps to the last index.

```

**Example 2:**

```javascript 
Input: nums = [2,3,0,1,4]
Output: 2

```

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= nums.length <= 104`
*   `0 <= nums[i] <= 1000`
*   It's guaranteed that you can reach `nums[n - 1]`.
