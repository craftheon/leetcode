<Problem slug="add-one-row-to-tree" id="623" title="Add One Row to Tree" difficulty="Medium" tags={[{"name":"Tree","slug":"tree"},{"name":"Depth-First Search","slug":"depth-first-search"},{"name":"Breadth-First Search","slug":"breadth-first-search"},{"name":"Binary Tree","slug":"binary-tree"}]} >
    Given the `root` of a binary tree and two integers `val` and `depth`, add a row of nodes with value `val` at the given depth `depth`.

Note that the `root` node is at depth `1`.

The adding rule is:

*   Given the integer `depth`, for each not null tree node `cur` at the depth `depth - 1`, create two tree nodes with value `val` as `cur`'s left subtree root and right subtree root.
*   `cur`'s original left subtree should be the left subtree of the new left subtree root.
*   `cur`'s original right subtree should be the right subtree of the new right subtree root.
*   If `depth == 1` that means there is no depth `depth - 1` at all, then create a tree node with value `val` as the new root of the whole original tree, and the original tree is the new root's left subtree.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/03/15/addrow-tree.jpg)
```javascript 
Input: root = [4,2,6,3,1,5], val = 1, depth = 2
Output: [4,1,1,2,null,null,6,3,1,5]
```

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/03/11/add2-tree.jpg)
```javascript 
Input: root = [4,2,null,3,1], val = 1, depth = 3
Output: [4,2,null,1,1,3,null,null,1]
```

**Constraints:**

*   The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 104]`.
*   The depth of the tree is in the range `[1, 104]`.
*   `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`
*   `-105 <= val <= 105`
*   `1 <= depth <= the depth of tree + 1`
